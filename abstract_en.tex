Why Uzi is God? Before we discuss this, let me talk about where other ADCs fall short compared to God Uzi.

First is Piglet, guilty of the sin of pride.

Dodging a Gragas barrel with a sidestep and smirking with disdain—such an arrogant ADC was doomed to fall. And so he did. After winning against God with a sneaky minion-piercing Q, he was on a steady decline, eventually fading into obscurity. In contrast, God is humble. His Jhin in S6 and Xayah in S7 were mercies bestowed upon mere mortals. It wasn't that God couldn't play them perfectly; He simply chose not to, avoiding utterly crushing His opponents with flawless performance. It's laughable that some failed to understand God's profound benevolence and even used this to mock Him. I advise you to think twice.

Next is Imp, guilty of the sin of wrath.

Starting a fight with Koreans at the next table for bad-mouthing China, furiously typing his own ID in solo queue whenever someone mentioned God's name—he violated God's teaching in the "New Testament": "I believe a player must be able to control his emotions well." And thus, God bestowed His punishment: Imp's personal life fell apart, his wife took his bank cards and seized his passport, and he succumbed to smoking, never to recover his former glory.

Then comes Bang, guilty of the sin of sloth.

He thought he was something special after winning two World Championships, even creating his own "meditation training method." What many don't know is that before the S7 semifinals, when Bang closed his eyes to meditate, the image that appeared in his mind was Uzi, standing radiant in the light. And God told him, "You may come this far, but no further." However, God's warning failed to steer Bang back to the right path. He even dared to join forces with LCK's chief demon, Faker, to challenge God's authority in the semifinals. So, God delivered His judgment: Bang's reputation was ruined in the finals, his two World Championship titles forgotten, forever remembered only as "Bang the Pusher."

And then we have Ruler, guilty of the sin of envy.

Though repeatedly defeated by God, Ruler was never truly convinced in his heart. He secretly envied God, even having the audacity to claim in public that he could have been better with proper preparation. Therefore, at the most prestigious LoL tournament—the Asian Games—Ruler was utterly defeated by God in direct confrontation. However, in recognition of Ruler's eventual conversion to God's doctrine and his fulfillment of God's will by vanquishing the repeatedly insolent Bang, God granted him all his successes with Samsung Gen.G.
